This is my Final Year Project "Electric Energy Demand And Forecasting System" developed in collaboration with my amazing teammates Fatima Zahid and Faiza Anum.ðŸ’ª

With the growing demand for efficient power management and sustainability, accurate energy forecasting is more important than ever. Traditional methods often fall short due to non-linear patterns, seasonal variations, and dynamic consumption trends.

Our solution? A Flask-based web application that uses Prophet for long-term forecasting and LSTM for short-term accuracy. We also integrated interactive visualizations with Plotly, ensured secure user authentication, and evaluated performance using MAE, RMSE, and Relative Error %.

Working of Our Project:

1st step. User uploads energy consumption dataset

2nd step. Data preprocessing & visualization

3rd step. ML Models applied for forecasting
. LSTM for short-term prediction
. Prophet for long-term forecasting

4th step. Performance evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE

5th step. Forecasted results visualized using interactive graphs.
