This is my Final Year Project "Electric Energy Demand And Forecasting System" developed in collaboration with my amazing teammates Fatima Zahid and Faiza Anum.💪

With the growing demand for efficient power management and sustainability, accurate energy forecasting is more important than ever. Traditional methods often fall short due to non-linear patterns, seasonal variations, and dynamic consumption trends.

Our solution? A Flask-based web application that uses Prophet for long-term forecasting and LSTM for short-term accuracy. We also integrated interactive visualizations with Plotly, ensured secure user authentication, and evaluated performance using MAE, RMSE, and Relative Error %.

Working of Our Project:

1st step. User uploads energy consumption dataset

2nd step. Data preprocessing & visualization

3rd step. ML Models applied for forecasting
. LSTM for short-term prediction
. Prophet for long-term forecasting

4th step. Performance evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE

5th step. Forecasted results visualized using interactive graphs.
